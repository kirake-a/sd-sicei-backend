    This API allows you to manage key entities in the school system, such as students, subjects, and grades. It provides endpoints for performing CRUD operations, applying filters, sorting results, and handling domain-relevant exceptions. 
    Its architecture follows the Clean Architecture pattern, dividing the system into domain, application, and infrastructure layers, which facilitates maintenance, scalability, and testing. 
    The API is designed to integrate easily with front-end clients, offering data validation, structured responses, and appropriate error handling through custom exceptions.
